# KerrRingdown

This repository contains a *Mathematica paclet* called __KerrRingdown\`__ for fitting a Numerical Relativity ring-down signal as a linear combination of Quasinormal modes.
The various fitting methods implemented in this package are based on the methods outlined in [Cook (2020)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.024027) and [Gao, Cook, et al (2025)]().  Please see these reference for details and cite these references when publishing results based on these packages.

Version 1.0.0 contains all of the functionality described in [Cook (2020)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.024027), plus some additional functionality described in [Gao, Cook, et al (2025)]().  This version of the code was used in the comparison paper [Maga√±a Zertuche, Gao, Finch, and Cook (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03155), and includes full documentation.

Version 1.1.0 adds additional funtionality and was used in [Gao, Cook, et al (2025)]().  In particular, *Greedy fitting* and limited fitting of *quadratic modes* are now fully implemented in this release.  However, the Mathematica-Style Documentation of these two new features has not yet been added.  Please look for these in a future update.

## Paclet

#### KerrRingdown\`
The actual *Mathematica paclet* is found in the KerrRingdown directory of the top level of the repository.  This paclet supports the following main operations:
1. Reading in Numerical Relativity gravitational waveforms.
2. Loading in tables of Quasinormal Modes.
3. Performing linear and non-linear fitting using:
  + The Eigenvalue Methods (both standard and simulation subspace limited).
  + Linear Least-Squares based on SVD fitting on the Design Matrix or the Normal Equation.
4. Plotting the signal and fit functions.
5. Plotting the Quasinormal Mode expansion coefficients.

## Build and Installing the Paclet

The file __CreatePaclets.nb__ is included in the top level of the repository.  It can be used to build the paclet from source.  Once built, the paclet can be found in the source directory __KerrRindown/build__ with the name __KerrRindown-#.#.#.paclet__. Public releases will also be available containing pre-built versions of the KerrRingdown\` paclet which can be installed directly into your *Mathematica* installation.

Paclet installation is accomplished by using the *Mathematica* function __PacletInstall__.

## Tables of Quasinormal Modes.

The __KerrRingdown\`__ paclet requires a set of tabulated quasinormal modes stored in a set of HDF5 files.  These files are not included in the Github repository, but can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14024959 "Quasinormal Mode Repo").  Note that the current version of __KerrRingdown\`__ requires the files from __*Version V3*__.  Prior versions use a data format that will not work correctly.  The tabulated quasinormal modes are stores in files named __KerrQNM___*nn*__.h5__, where *nn* is a 2-digit number indicating the value of the overtones for the modes stored in each file.

## Mathematica-Style Documentation

Full Mathematica-style documentation is included with the paclet.  This includes detailed documentation for each publicly callable function, a *Function Guide*, and a *Tech Note*.  The *Tech Note* includes details on how fitting works with the paclet.  To view the documentation, first use __PacletInstall__ to intall the __KerrRingdown\`__ paclet, then execute the command __Needs["KerrRingdown\`"]__ to load the functions and their documentation.  At this point, you can search the *Mathematica* documentation for *Kerr Ringdown*, or you could enter the name of one of its functions to access its documentation.  For example, the function __HDF5QNMDir__ is used to specify the directory where the tabulated quasinormal mode data files are found, and the documentation for this function will also lead you to the *Function Guide* and a *Tech Note*.
